Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Christian Hosam and I am a fifth year PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California Berkeley and a Graduate Student Researcher with the [UC Berkeley Possibility Lab](https://possibilitylab.berkeley.edu). My work has been published in <i>Politics, Groups, and Identites</i> and <i>Sociological Forum</i>. I am also the co-author of <i>Latino Politics, 3rd ed.</i>, with Professor Lisa Garcia Bedolla. I have also received generous research funding support from the [Social Science Research Council](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/drugs-security-and-democracy-program/democratic-anxieties-in-the-americas-research-grants/grantees/), the [UC Berkeley Institute for Governmental Studies](https://igs.berkeley.edu/student-opportunities/awards-grants), the [UC Berkeley Center for the Study of Law and Society](https://csls.berkeley.edu), and the [APSA Diversity Fellowship Program](https://apsanet.org/dfp). 

In addition to my academic work, I have also written for public outlets such as [Dissent Magazine](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/from-police-brutality-to-the-city-budget) and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/06/15/the-supreme-courts-long-war-against-voting-rights/). 
  
Outside of work, I can be found in the gym, listening to the same music on repeat, or walking my dog Penelope.

## Research Agenda 
All of my research projects are driven by thinking about structural aspects of the American political economy play out in the day-to-day lives of Black people and other communities of color. My dissertation book project looks at how the shifting nature of Congress as an institution in the years following the Civil Rights Movement led to increased descriptive representation on one hand but increasing constraints on the types of transformational policies that can materially change the lives of Black people. I have other work on the American maternal mortality crisis and how the structure of American healthcare uniquely imperils the life course of Black women.
