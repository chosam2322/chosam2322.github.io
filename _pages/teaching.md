My teaching interests are centered around topics related the intersection of race, representation, public policy, and the American Political Economy.  

## Potential Courses Include: 
1. Black Politics
2. Congress
3. American Political Economy
4. Race, States, and Markets
5. The Craft of Research in Political Science

## Teaching as Instructor of Record
In the Summer of 2023, I will be teaching my own course: 

"A Seat at The Table? Race and Representation in American Institutional Life"
**Description:** *The fight for increased inclusion into American society and culture created new opportunities and dynamics for American politics but how might we understand if and how this has translated into material gains for marginalized groups? This course will look at the ways in which representation became a political demand in ways both tied and untied from other goals like anti-poverty and human rights, the economic and judicial processes that shaped the demand for political representation, the ways that representational politics plays out specifically in the realm of Black politics (with a specific focus on the politics of race, representation, and the Congressional Black Caucus), and the dialectical relationship between politics and popular culture in the 21st Century. Can representation save us? Should it?*
  
## Teaching Experience as a Graduate Student Instructor

I will also be completing the UC Berkeley [Certificate in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/certificate-program/) in Fall 2023.
