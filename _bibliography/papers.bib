	abstract = {The third edition of this popular text provides students with a comprehensive introduction to Latino political engagement in US politics. Focusing on six Latino groups Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans the book explores the migration history of each and examines their political status on arrival in the United States, including their civil rights, employment opportunities, and political incorporation. Finally, the analysis follows each groups history of collective mobilization and political activity, drawing out the varied ways they have engaged in the US political system. Fully revised and updated, the new edition explores the state of Latino politics under both the Obama and Trump Administrations, discussing issues such as migrant detention at the USMexico border, the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, and the thawing of relations between the United States and Cuba. It encourages students to think critically about what it means to be a racialized minority group within a majoritarian US political system, and how that position structures Latinos ability to achieve their social, economic, and political goals.},

	abstract = {Are appeals to discredit mainstream media reporting of political news in the guise of “fake news” merely a diversion from more fundamental threats to democratic politics and policymaking? Or is the emerging belief in “fake news” itself a looming threat? Using data from the Voter Study Group’s panel survey, we examine the relationship between disbelief in mainstream media and a wide range of social attitudes and policy preferences. We find that in December 2016, just after Trump’s election, belief in fake news wields an outsized influence, independent of partisanship, ideology, media consumption, and other established foundations of public opinion. The effects of fake news beliefs are especially pronounced on key elements of Trump’s rhetoric as candidate and as president—hostility toward immigrants, racial and religious minorities, gender equality, perceptions of America’s “greatness,” and even support for democratic norms and institutions itself. We also find some evidence that by January 2019, the belief in fake news has become even more focally associated with Trump. These findings portend the possibility of an emerging exclusionary, populist variant of American conservatism, of which disbelief in media institutions is a key component.},
