In this role, I assisted the research firm Sojourn Strategies in developing a survey for a statistically significant sample size of Black respondents to measure their feelings of self-efficacy in the run-up to the 2020 Presidential Election. Then, in a subsequent project, I helped construct a research protocol and session guide for community conversations to help us understand how members of three community-based organizations conceptualize the concept of "political home."
